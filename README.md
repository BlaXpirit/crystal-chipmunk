# crystal-chipmunk

#### [Crystal][] bindings to [Chipmunk][] (2D rigid body physics library).

Requires Chipmunk 7.

Works only with the ['Extern attribute' feature](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/pull/3051), so Crystal must be compiled from [the branch](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/tree/feature/extern2)

[License](LICENSE): MIT.

This library uses and is based on [Chipmunk][].

Tests are based on [pymunk][]'s unittests.
